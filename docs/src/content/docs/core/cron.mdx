If you want to schedule a background task, [Cloudflare supports Cron Triggers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/).

## Setup

Within your `worker.tsx` file, adjust your `defineApp` function:

```tsx
const app = defineApp([
  ...
]);

export default {
  fetch: app.fetch,
  async scheduled(controller: ScheduledController) {
    // Write code for updating your API
    switch (controller.cron) {
      // Runs every minute
      case "* * * * *":
        console.log("üßπ Clean up Unverified Users");
        break;
    }
    console.log("‚è∞ cron processed");
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Cron jobs are "named" based on their schedule. In the example above, `console.log("üßπ Clean up Unverified Users");` runs every minute. However, you could account for different schedules by adding more cases to your `switch` statement:

```tsx
// Runs every hour
case "0 0 * * *":
  console.log("üîÑ Update something");
  break;
}
```
