description: Messages, queues, and background tasks

Whilst building a website you want to be able to respond as quickly as possible to user interactions, but sometimes you need to do things that take a long time to complete. For example, you might need to send an email when a user submits a form, or you need to process a payment. These tasks are called background tasks.

Background tasks are handled by the queue system. You send a message to a queue, and a worker will process the message.


### Setup

First thing you've got to do is create a queue and bind the queue producers and consumers to your worker.
```bash
npx wrangler queues create MY_QUEUE_NAME
```

Replace "MY_QUEUE_NAME" with the name of your queue.

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "queues": {
    "producers": [
      {
        "binding": "QUEUE",
        "queue": "MY_QUEUE_NAME",
      }
    ],
    "consumers": [
      {
        "queue": "MY_QUEUE_NAME",
        "max_batch_size": 10,
        "max_batch_timeout": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Sending messages

the `QUEUE` object will now be available in your worker via the `env` object.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx"
export default defineApp([
  route('/pay', ({ env }) => {
    // Post a message to the queue
    env.QUEUE.send({
      userId: 1,
      amount: 100,
      currency: 'USD',
    })
  })
])
```

### Receiving messages

In order to receive and "consume" messages from the queue you need to change the shape of the default export
of your worker.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx"

const app = defineApp([ /* routes... */])

export default {
  fetch: app.fetch,
  async queue(batch) {
    for (const message of batch) {
      console.log(message)
    }
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

This will now consume messages from the queue.
