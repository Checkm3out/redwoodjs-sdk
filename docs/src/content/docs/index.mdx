RedwoodSDK is a React framework for building webapps. It's optimized for the Cloudflare Development Platform,
which means you can build your webapp with a database, queues, storage, and much more! All in one place, without
having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

It also means that your local development experience has database, queues, and storage without having to install anything! Development matches
production, and you can deploy your website to Cloudflare with a single command. It just works!

- No magic exports
- No magic imports
- No magic components
- No magic utils
- No magic types
- No magic anything

You focus on the request/response cycle, and we provide a set of tools to help you build your website.
