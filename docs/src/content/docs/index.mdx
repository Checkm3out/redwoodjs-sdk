RedwoodSDK is a composable toolkit for building server-driven webapps on Cloudflare. It starts as a **Vite plugin** that unlocks **SSR**, **React Server Components**, **Server Functions**, and **realtime**. Its standards-based router—with middleware and interruptors—gives you precise control over every request and response. With built-in access to Cloudflare’s Workers, Database (D1), Storage (R2), Queues, and AI—and full local emulation via Miniflare—development feels just like production.

    	Create a new project by running the following command, replacing {"<project-name>"} with your project name

    	```bash
    	npx degit redwoodjs/sdk/starters/standard#main <project-name>

## Design Philosophy

We believe that the best way to build webapps is to be standards-compliant, to adhere to the request/response paradigm, and to be transparent and composable.

### Standards compliant

We've removed the pain of abstracting away the underlying platform, and instead embraced it. The browser is the primary focus, with the request/response cycle as the foundation.

### Request/Response

The `Request` and `Response` objects are the foundation of the request/response paradigm.
By focusing on these objects, you'll able to seamlessly integrate with the web, streaming responses to the browser, and even build realtime applications.

### Transparent and composable

You are able to follow the flow from request to response, and to understand, and mofify, how each step is handled.

- No hidden files
- No magic imports / exports
- No generated types
