## Installing Storybook

Becayse the RedwoodSDK is based on React and Vite, we can work through the ["React & Vite" documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/react-vite).

<Steps>
1. Install Storybook
    ```bash
    pnpm create storybook@latest
    ```

2. Select what you want to use Storybook for. I selected both Documentation and Testing. (ARI INSERT SCREENSHOT)

3. It'll say it can't detect the framework. Select React. It'll automatically detect Vite. (ARI INSERT SCREENSHOT)

4. Storybook will finish installing, and start your Storybook server. (ARI INSERT SCREENSHOT)

5. It should automatically open your browser to Storybook, but if it doesn't, you can go to `localhost:6006` to see it. (ARI INSERT SCREENSHOT)

6. Next, let's experiment with adding a component. (ARI TODOOOO)
