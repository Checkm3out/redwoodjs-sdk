  <p>
    Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It allows you to create and test components without needing to run your full application.

    This guide covers setup and some basics. For full documentation, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://storybook.js.org">Storybook site</a>.

## Installing Storybook

Because the RedwoodSDK is based on React and Vite, we can work through the <a target="_blank" href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/react-vite">"React & Vite" documentation</a>.

<Steps>
1. Install Storybook
    ```bash
    pnpm create storybook@latest
    ```

2. Select what you want to use Storybook for. I selected both Documentation and Testing.

3. It'll say it can't detect the framework. Select React. It'll automatically detect Vite.

4. Storybook will finish installing, and start your Storybook server.

5. It should automatically open your browser to Storybook, but if it doesn't, you can go to `localhost:6006` to see it.
