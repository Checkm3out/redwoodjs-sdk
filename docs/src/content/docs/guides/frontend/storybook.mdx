<Aside type="note" title="What is Storybook?">
  <p>
    Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It allows you to create and test components without needing to run your full application. It can also be a great way to document your components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Developing UI in isolation is especially useful if you have a component that relies on network requests or your database â€” you can mock any dependencies and focus on building the component itself.

    This guide covers setup and some basics. For full documentation and some demos, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://storybook.js.org">Storybook site</a>.

## Installing Storybook

Because the RedwoodSDK is based on React and Vite, we can work through the <a target="_blank" href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/react-vite">"React & Vite" documentation</a>.

<Steps>
1. Install Storybook
    ```bash
    pnpm create storybook@latest
    ```

2. Select what you want to use Storybook for. I selected both Documentation and Testing.

3. It'll say it can't detect the framework. Select React. It'll automatically detect Vite.

4. Storybook will finish installing, and start your Storybook server.

5. It should automatically open your browser to Storybook, but if it doesn't, you can go to `localhost:6006` to see it.

7. You'll also see that it added `storybook` and `storybook-build` scripts to your `package.json` file. You can always run `pnpm storybook` to start the Storybook server, and `pnpm storybook-build` to build your Storybook site for production.
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
        "storybook-build": "storybook build"
      }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="Wait, Storybook is showing me some random components!">
  <p>
    Storybook comes with some boilerplate components and stories. You can delete the `src/stories` folder to get rid of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, if you're new to Storybook, I recommend keeping them around for a bit and taking a look at the files it added. They show you how to set up a Storybook component and how to use and customize the Storybook UI.

## Adding a Component to Storybook

In writing this guide, we've started by following the [quick start instructions](../../getting-started/quick-start) and set up the standard starter.

The standard starter comes with a very basic `Home` component:

```tsx title="src/app/pages/Home.tsx"
import { RequestInfo } from "@redwoodjs/sdk/worker";

export function Home({ ctx }: RequestInfo) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {ctx.user?.username
          ? `You are logged in as user ${ctx.user.username}`
          : "You are not logged in"}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Given that this is very basic, you'd most likely want to build this out a bit more. Storybook is the perfect place to do that! Let's see what that looks like.

<Steps>
1. Create a new file: `src/app/pages/Home.stories.tsx`
    ```tsx title="src/app/pages/Home.stories.tsx"
    ARI YOU ARE HERE
    ```
2. Now, if you go back to your Storybook site, you should see a new "Home" section in the sidebar.
