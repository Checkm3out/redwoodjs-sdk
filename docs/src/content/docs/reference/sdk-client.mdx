The `rwsdk/client` module provides a set of functions for client-side operations.

## `initClient`

The `initClient` function is used to initialize the React Client. This hydrates the RSC flight payload that's add at the bottom of the page. This makes the page interactive.

## `initClientNavigation`

The `initClientNavigation` function is used to initialize the client side navigation. An event handler is assocated to clicking the document. If the clicked element contains a link, href, and the href is a relative path, the event handler will be triggered. This will then fetch the RSC payload for the new page, and hydrate it on the client.
