The jobs application list page lists all the jobs that we've applied for. For this tutorial, it will also serve as the Dashboard. ([In the Advanced Topics Tutorial, we'll iterate on the Dashboard]())

The finished page will look like this:

![]()

Let's start with the frontend code and then we'll query the database to make it dynamic.

But, first, we need a route.




- Creating the main jobs page layout
- Building and styling the jobs table using ShadCN Table component
- Implementing sorting and filtering
- Adding the "Create New Job" button with ShadCN Button component
- Responsive design considerations
