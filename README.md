# RedwoodSDK Monorepo

RedwoodSDK is a composable framework for building server-driven webapps on Cloudflare. It starts as a **Vite plugin** that unlocks **SSR**, **React Server Components**, **Server Functions**, and **realtime**. Its standards-based router—with middleware and interruptors—gives you precise control over every request and response. With built-in access to Cloudflare’s Workers, Database (D1), Storage (R2), Queues, and AI—and full local emulation via Miniflare—development feels just like production.
