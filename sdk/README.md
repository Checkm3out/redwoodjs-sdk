# RedwoodSDK

RedwoodSDK is a composable toolkit for building server-driven webapps on Cloudflare. It starts as a _Vite plugin_ that unlocks _SSR_, _React Server Components_, _Server Functions_, and _realtime_. Its standards-based router—with middleware and interruptors—gives you precise control over every request and response. With built-in access to Cloudflare’s Workers, Database (D1), Storage (R2), Queues, and AI—and full local emulation via Miniflare—development feels just like production.
